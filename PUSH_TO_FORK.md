# üöÄ Push Code to Your Own Fork

## üîç Check Current Remote

First, check what remote you're currently connected to:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This will show you the current remote URLs. You'll see something like:
```
origin  https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git (push)
```

## üîß Change Remote to Your Fork

### Step 1: Remove Current Origin
```bash
git remote remove origin
```

### Step 2: Add Your Fork as Origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pooling-engie.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Verify the Change
```bash
git remote -v
```

You should now see:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pooling-engie.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pooling-engie.git (push)
```

## üöÄ Push to Your Fork

### Step 1: Add All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues and add Railway configuration"
```

### Step 3: Push to Your Fork
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If your default branch is `master` instead of `main`:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## üîÑ Alternative: Create New Repository

If you want to create a completely new repository:

### Step 1: Create New Repo on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it `pooling-engie` or whatever you prefer
3. Make it public or private
4. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Update Remote
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_NEW_REPO.git
```

### Step 3: Push
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## üéØ Quick Commands Summary

```bash
# Check current remote
git remote -v

# Remove current origin
git remote remove origin

# Add your fork as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pooling-engie.git

# Add and commit changes

# Push to your fork
git push -u origin main
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If you get "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### If you get authentication errors
1. Use GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
2. Or use Personal Access Token
3. Or use SSH: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/pooling-engie.git`

### If you're not sure about your branch name
```bash
git branch
```
This will show your current branch name.

## ‚úÖ After Pushing

1. **Go to your GitHub fork**
2. **Verify all files are there**
3. **Deploy to Railway using your fork URL**
4. **Update Railway to use your repository**

## üéâ Success!

Your code is now in your own repository and ready for deployment!
