# ðŸš¨ Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem
The deployment failed because `pnpm-lock.yaml` was out of sync with `package.json`.

## âœ… What I Fixed

1. **Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml`** - This was causing the conflict
2. **Removed `proxy` field** - Not needed for production
3. **Added `railway.json`** - Railway configuration
4. **Cleaned `package.json`** - Removed unnecessary fields

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Option 1: Let Railway Auto-Detect (Recommended)
1. **Go to your Railway project**
2. **Click "Deploy" again**
3. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect it's a Next.js project
   - Install dependencies with npm
   - Build the project
   - Deploy successfully

### Option 2: Manual Fix (If needed)
If Railway still has issues:

1. **In Railway dashboard:**
   - Go to "Settings"
   - Set "Root Directory" to `/` (not `/server`)
   - Set "Build Command" to `npm install && npm run build`
   - Set "Start Command" to `npm start`

2. **Add Environment Variables:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Why This Happened

- The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file was outdated
- Railway prefers `npm` over `pnpm` for better compatibility
- The `proxy` field in package.json is only for development

## âœ… Expected Result

After this fix, your deployment should:
- âœ… Build successfully
- âœ… Deploy without errors
- âœ… Work with your backend

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test

Once deployed:
1. Open your Railway frontend URL
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Test the WebSocket connection
